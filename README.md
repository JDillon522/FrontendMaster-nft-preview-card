## Overview

I chose this challenge as something simple to do where I could experiment with compiling SCSS files via npm scripts. All said and done, I probably have 2 hours of actual work in this.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
